## Inspiration
I have created this project keeping the hackathon theme in mind of retro, I'm passionate for seeing movies whether its old or new.

## What it does
Its a website that has movies from 1960s to 2017, all popular movies in one place. It also has the option for booking tickets and seeing latest news.

## How I built it
I have used Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS fro creating the website.

## Challenges I ran into
I wasn't able to execute all the functionalities in the given time and was also short of some technical skills.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud that i was able to make my own movie website with some old movies.

## What I learned
Old Movies information and some new facts related to web technologies.

## What's next for MovieTrends
I will add more movies and some link to watch the trailer of this movie.
